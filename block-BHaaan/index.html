                <p>Climate change is defined as shifts in the earth‚Äôs climate driven by human activities, mainly greenhouse gas emissions caused by burning fossil fuels</p>
                <p> Global temperatures are slated to rise by at least 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2030, but we are already living the devastating impacts of global warming.</p>
                <p>As the planet warms, extreme weather events such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts become more frequent and intense. </p>
                <p>Unfortunately, those who have contributed the least to climate change are affected the most. Without immediate action, the climate crisis could lead to widespread poverty, hunger and migration.</p>

                <h2>Why is our climate changing?</h2>
                <img src="media/climate_change_1.gif" alt="Climate Change" width=600px/>
                <p>The global climate is the connected system of sun, earth and oceans, wind, rain and snow, forests, deserts and savannas, and everything people do, too</p>
                <p>The climate of a place, say New York, can be described as its rainfall, changing temperatures during the year and so on.</p>
                <p>But the global climate is more than the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù of the climates of specific places.</p>
                <p>A description of the global climate includes how, for example, the rising temperature of the Pacific feeds typhoons which blow harder.</p>
                <p>It is this systemic connectedness that makes global climate change so important and so complicated.</p>
